What is this?
Challenge 2 is a task assigned to the Front End Boot Camp for Amazon employees so they can learn how to edit HTML code. In this task, the HTML page for the SEO home page needs some tweaks.

What needs to be done?
1) The Search Engine Optimization link needs to be fixed
2) The images should contain alternate text to improve the HTML pageâ€™s accessibility
3) Use semantic guidelines for proper HTML coding:  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
